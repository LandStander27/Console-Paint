## Console Paint
- Just a project I'm testing out

#### Building
- Install [VLang](https://vlang.io) and add to `PATH`
- Download GCC from [here](https://winlibs.com/) and add bin to `PATH`
- Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/LandStander27/Console-Paint.git`
- Run `make.bat` (or if you are using my custom made terminal, VTerminal, run `make.vterm`)
- Compiled binary will be in `.\bin\paint.exe`
